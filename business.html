    About ESSENS ESSENS is currently one of the most dynamic MLM companies in
    Europe. It was established in autumn 2011 in Czech Republic based on the
    cooperation with professionals in network marketing and leading experts in
    the area of development and production of cosmetics and food supplements. At
    first ESSENS gained its respect and recognition by introducing exclusive
    perfumes with the highest possible quality on the market. The international
    team thoroughly choose between the most suitable fragrances from one of the
    world's leading suppliers of perfume essences. Soon the first products from
    the area of special nutrition and food supplements came, thanks to these
    products our future was significantly influenced by new partners from the
    front European leaders among pharmaceutical companies. Because of this we
    still bring new products in our range of goods, which thanks to our network
    of members and distributors influence the market of many countries and bring
    invaluable benefit to millions of satisfied customers. ESSENS offers much
    more than it seems at first glance. The name itself covers several meanings
    and words. It is the identically pronounced as an English word “essence”,
    which stands for the basis or foundation, as well as the aromatic essences
    which you can feel in our perfume or in your future with ESSENS. And did you
    notice that you hear a world “sense” while pronouncing ESSENS? We use our
    senses to perceive the world around us and they are our closest allies
    guiding us through our lives. According to many economists, network
    marketing represents one of the fastest ways to financial independence and
    the fulfilment of one’s dreams. ESSENS also contains the Czech word “sen”,
    which simply means a “dream” which stays inextricably linked with ESSENS. By
    the beginning of 2016, we opened a brand new, modern ESSENS EUROPE
    headquarters in Brno. This event has put us among the most prosperous
    companies in the field. New modern base was built, so each one of our
    members who visits us feels comfortable and knows that we are here
    exclusively just for him.
